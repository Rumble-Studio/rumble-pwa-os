<h1>General Terms of Use Rumble Studio</h1>

<section>
	<h3>What is the Rumble Studio Service?</h3>

	<p>
		Rumble Studio is an online public communication service that enables its users (Hosts) to create and produce media
		content (in particular podcasts) by inviting participants (Guests) to share content or record verbal contributions via
		the online interface made available by Rumble Studio in the form of a Software as a Service (SaaS). The podcasts are
		produced by the Hosts on their own account or on behalf of their own clients (Agency Hosts). Podcasts or other media
		content (Content) created through Rumble Studio are made available to the public by Hosts through third-party broadcast
		services or directly from the Rumble Studio service.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>What are the terms of use of the Rumble Studio service?</h3>
	<p>
		The present document (the General Terms of Use or GTOU) sets out the terms and conditions under which you are permitted
		to use the Rumble Studio service, regardless of your capacity: Host, Agency Host or Guest. For clarity, our GTOU are
		divided into three parts: A
		<em>first part</em> devoted to the general provisions applicable to the provision and use of our service; A
		<em>second part</em> devoted to the technical terms of operating the Rumble Studio SaaS. A <em>third part</em> completes
		our GTOU. This involves the rules relating to the management of Content created using our platform and broadcast via a
		third-party broadcasting service or directly from the Rumble Studio service. If you have a problem with any Content
		created or distributed by a Rumble Studio User, we invite you to consult this dedicated section in our GTOU.

<section>
	<h3>Acceptance of GTOU</h3>
	<p>
		Whether you are a Host or a Guest, you must agree to our GTOU before using the Rumble Studio Service. Your acceptance of
		our GTOU is given by activating a checkbox when you first use the Service. If you are accepting the GTOU on behalf of a
		legal person (for example, as an employee or representative of the company for which you work), you warrant that you
		have the necessary powers or authorisations to contractually bind that legal person. You acknowledge that failure to
		comply with the GTOU when using the Service in the future will result in your liability and that of the legal person on
		whose behalf you are acting. For the sake of clarity, if you are an Agency (as defined in Clause 2 below), you shall be
		solely responsible for using the Service on behalf of your clients and, as an end user of the Rumble Studio Service, you
		assume all of the obligations imposed on Hosts by our GTOU. The GTOU constitute the entire agreement between Rumble
		Studio and the User in respect of the use of the Service. They shall apply exclusively, excluding all other provisions.
		By way of an exception to the above, Rumble Studio may agree to specific provisions with a Host as an addition to the
		GTOU. These provisions shall be documented in writing and expressly accepted by each of the parties involved. Any
		special conditions shall specify the rules of precedence applicable between the provisions they contain and the
		provisions of the GTOU.

capacity will result in all or part of the Stored Contents being temporarily or permanently inaccessible. At the end of a period
of thirty (30) days from the date of the change that led to the reduction in storage capacity, Rumble Studio reserves the right
to permanently and irreversibly delete all or part of the Contents Stored on Rumble Studio’s or its subcontractors’ servers,
following one single notice sent by email to the address registered in the Host’s User account. Hosts acknowledge that they have
been informed that if they fail to download all of the Stored Contents within a period of thirty (30) days, Rumble Studio cannot
guarantee the availability of the Stored Contents. Contents created may also be transferred to a Third-Party Service provider
server with a view to its distribution to the public (see Clause 12.3.2 above). Where Stored Contents include personal data
within the meanings of applicable regulations, the third-party hosts shall act as “sub-processor” for Rumble Studio within the
meanings of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the principles
set out in Clause 14 and Appendix A. 13.2 Service Security 13.2.1 Rumble Studio implements technical and organisational measures
in accordance with the state of the art in order to secure its information system and access to the Service as part of a general
obligation of means [“obligation générale de moyens”]. 13.2.2 Users hereby acknowledge that, given the state of the art and
current techniques, and in particular the hazards associated with the use of open communication networks such as the Internet,
Rumble Studio cannot guarantee that the Rumble Studio Service will not be subject to security incidents (such as an exploitation
of a vulnerability and/or an attack by means of malware, and in particular unknown or unlisted vulnerabilities and/or malware)
or that such security incidents will never affect the Stored Content. Users hereby declare that they accept these risks, which
may affect the quality of the Service provided by Rumble Studio within the meanings of Article 1133 paragraph 3 of the French
Civil Code. 13.3 Maintenance and Support 13.3.1 Rumble Studio shall be exclusively responsible for the Service’s development and
corrective maintenance. All requests for assistance should be addressed to Rumble Studio at support@rumble.studio. 13.3.2
Support requests related to the use of the Service should be directed to support@rumble.studio. Where the Host subscribes to a
multiple user registration package, the number of individual users allowed to contact the support service shall be limited to
three (3) persons. In order to benefit from greater access to the support service and/or the implementation of a personalised
“train the trainer” type training programme, Hosts are invited to contact Rumble Studio to agree special terms and conditions.
Personal data processing Personal data included in the Stored Content shall be processed by the Host as data controller. Hosts
shall be responsible for compliance with obligations incumbent in this regard under the French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of
06 January 1978 as amended (“LIL”) and EU Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation - “GDPR”).
For the purposes of providing the Service, Rumble Studio shall act as a data processor to Hosts. Rumble Studio shall act in
accordance with and within the limits of the instructions documented in Appendix A. The terms “data” or “personal data” shall
have the same meaning as the term “personal data” in the GDPR. The terms “processing”, “data controller”, “data processor” or
“recipient” are used in the GTOU and in Appendix A in accordance with the meaning given to them in Article 4 of the GDPR.

<h2>Part III - Content management</h2>

<section>
	<h3>Applicable Principles</h3>
	<p>
		This third part of the Rumble Studio GTOU is intended to serve as a guide for any User and/or any third party
		(hereinafter a “Notifier”) wishing to make a request for the removal of Content produced by a Host using the tools
		provided by Rumble Studio and made available to the public at the initiative of a Host via a Third-Party Service or
		directly via Rumble Studio. As a Notifier, you are hereby informed that Rumble Studio cannot be held liable for Contents
		produced, created and published by a Host unless Rumble Studio is at fault in the implementation of its removal
		obligation. Where the disputed Content is distributed to the public via a Third-Party Service, the Notifier is invited,
		before directing a request to Rumble Studio, to make the removal request directly (i) to the Third-Party Service
		concerned and/or (ii) to the Host where the latter is identified or identifiable. Handling of requests for removal from
		Notifiers Requests made in support of a decision by an administrative or judicial authority 16.1.1 Rumble Studio shall
		respond positively and promptly to any request for removal or suspension made by an administrative authority or by a
		judicial authority or to a notice that includes a decision by an administrative or judicial authority, regardless of
		whether the latter have ruled on the unlawfulness of a Content on their own initiative or at the request of a third
		party. In such cases, the Host understands and accepts that Rumble Studio is under no obligation to provide information
		to the Host if the matter is referred to it by an administrative or judicial authority. 16.1.2 The Host understands and
		accepts that Rumble Studio shall, at the request of an administrative or judicial authority, disclose all connection
		and/or identification data held by Rumble Studio. Requests made by a Guest 16.2.1 By virtue of the publication approval
		given by the Guest to the Host under Clause 7 of the GTOU, any illegality of Contents whose removal is requested by a
		Guest to Rumble Studio shall not be considered obvious or manifest within the meanings of Decision 2004-496 DC of the
		French Constitutional Council of 10 June 2004. 16.2.2 Accordingly, the Guest shall accept that any request for removal
		shall be subject to the adversarial principle. 16.2.3 In essence, any request for removal made by a Guest shall be
		submitted by Rumble Studio to the Host, which shall have seven (7) business days to convey its arguments to Rumble
		Studio and/or the Guest. 16.2.4 In the event of a disagreement based on arguments raised in good faith by a Host on a
		Guest’s request to remove, the dispute shall be submitted to the judicial authorities. Rumble Studio shall comply with
		the decision. It shall be the sole responsibility of the Host and/or Guest concerned to submit the dispute between them
		to the relevant jurisdiction. Rumble Studio shall entertain no responsibility in this regard. Requests made in a
		capacity other than that of a Guest Any request for removal made by a Notifier (other than a Guest) who has an interest
		in taking action must comply with a precise procedure to enable Rumble Studio to assess any obvious unlawful nature of
		the Content notified and to proceed, without prior intervention by the judicial authorities or an administrative
		authority, with the prompt removal of that Content. The Notifier shall understand and accept that in the event of
		non-compliance with the formalities described below, Rumble Studio shall not be able to remove the disputed Content. In
		this respect, it is pointed out hereby to the Notifier that certain Contents, insofar as they necessarily imply
		compliance with the adversarial principle, cannot be considered as manifestly unlawful by nature. This applies more
		specifically to Contents whose removal is requested on the basis of defamation, which cannot be removed without the
		Notifier producing a decision by the judicial authorities confirming the unlawful nature of this Content. In any case,
		the notice must include the following items: The name and e-mail address of the Notifier; Proof of an attempt to contact
		the Third-Party Service concerned, the request for removal previously sent to it or any evidence that the Third-Party
		Service cannot be contacted. The URL from which the Content is distributed to the public, including if it is an online
		public distribution service provided by Rumble Studio. A detailed and legal explanation of why the Notifier considers
		the offending Content to be unlawful or to contain unlawful material. The Notifier shall thus mention the legal source
		on which its notice is based and explain how, in its opinion, the publication of the Content makes it eligible for
		removal. A sworn statement that the notice is given in good faith and that the information provided is accurate and
		complete. In general, all items to enable Rumble Studio to assess the manifest illegality of Content without any legal
		analysis or additional information being required to assess the illegality of the Content or of certain components
		thereof. In the event of failure to comply with the formalities set out above, the Notifier shall understand that Rumble
		Studio will not be able to proceed with prompt removal of the Content and that it cannot be held liable for failure to
		comply with its obligations.
